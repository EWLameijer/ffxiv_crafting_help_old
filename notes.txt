velveteen doublet vest of crafting 1uv [0] 1dew thread [3] 1aldgoat leather  [1] 1silver ingot  [2] 1 brimstone [0]



Next phase:
1 crafted item (like the velveteen bandana) can need multiple of other items, like ingredients.
velveteen bandana: 3 undyed velveteen 1 sunrise tellin 1 bat fang
need: 3 dew thread, 4 cotton bolls (=4 yarn) 1 sunrise tellin 1 bat fang

How would I do this manually?
1) velveteen bandana: 3 undyed velveteen 1 sunrise tellin 1 bat fang
If I don't have any undyed velveteen:
undyed velveteen (Weaver 24) [null] 1 produced by 1x cotton yarn, 1x dew thread
if I don't have any cotton yarn:
cotton yarn (Weaver 12) [null] 2 produced by 2x cotton boll
Since I need 3 cotton yarn... that does not go nicely
So:
if #produced != 1 {
    times = #needed/#produced, add times*ingredientcount to needed-list [or update needed-list]
    overflow = #needed % #produced.
    if overflow != 0, add overflow item to overflow list
}


Problem:
A recipe can produce multiple items. What to do if you need 3 cotton yarn and a recipe produces two? You can round up,
but that leads to overkill if multiple recipes need 3 cotton yarn.

General strategy:

20220330 progress:
have dictionary of abbreviations: el ii 2ms; allow adding to it! So change recipe input.
have wishlist


// 20220327 progress:
// have introduced inventory, so can now check whether I have stuff that I need for crafting.
// next step: instead of saying need crafted/gathered item, collect information on the gathered and crafted item
// (recipes, locations);
If recipe not known: ask for it
If location not known: ask for it
// make wishlist?
// obstacle: mudstone already had location (: ...) So needed to make special parse for gathering materials
// next obstacle step: copy parse for crafting materials, then improve/simplify for gathering materials that do not have
// a usage



Analysis
1: save entire recipe => well, ingredients just as name
OK. 1: allow quitting


bone ring: bone chip ragstone whetstone
ragstone whetstone : 2x ragstone

item always has a name and a level
It also has some kind of category, either a gathering category or a crafting category

Concrete steps:
-> analysis: return if it is a raw material or a crafted material
-> if raw material, how to obtain it (and where?)
-> if crafted material
    recipe available? print basic recipe, ask for presence of ingredients
    recipe unavailable?
        make it be entered -> decorated bronze barbut (1) 1 bronze barbut 1 copper ingot 1 brass ingot.
        THEN ask for presence of ingredients
        if any ingredient not present IN THE REQUIRED QUANTITY,

        /also add option to make wishlist

TODO:

Ideal: type in a crafting recipe (or the start thereof. Just do entire name for now; later starting letters or infix).
Then get list of materials needed OR: question to enter recipe
If entering recipe:
1) how many are produced (often >1 for cooking)
2) [loop] #items #itemname
    // if itemname not known, dialogue:
        -vendor? V or V vendorName (like LTW)
        -misspelled: respell


3) save recipe, as  say 5 @hempen chausses L5 1 2 ing1 1 ing2, so LEVEL @name slot[startswithcapital] #made [ingname #ing]
    This will mean saving all lines.
4) then ask #items of each in inventory
5) if too few, ask for those items [if not raw material] the composition




DONE
First goal: get list of raw materials DONE!
Second goal: get information about method and level (HAR 3)
Third goal: allow searching on first letter(s), like "cop"

2022-03-16: 1 portie eten: 19:56-> discovered bug: bronze barbut H12; so if parsing a crafted item, may need to
    add a usage (string) => 20:16 (=>LOOSE) => ask for presence of ingredients
